# Tic-Tac-Toe

1. Install [golang](https://golang.org/)
2. Setup the \$GOPATH using this [guide](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH). This is a special directory strucutre where golang projects are stored. For me it is under `~/go/`
3. Run `go get github.com/JohannesKaufmann/tictactoe`. This automatically installs it at the correct location, inside the \$GOPATH
4. Switch to this directory by running `cd $GOPATH/github.com/JohannesKaufmann/tictactoe`
5. Once in this directory, run `go run main.go`
